# This project runs on Unity version 2021.3.6f1 found in the unity download archive (https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive), 
# find the version you want and click on the "Unity Hub" button to download it on Unity Hub which can be downloaded at (https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) and clicking the "Download Unity Hub" button
# NOTE: You will need to sign up for a Unity account which is free to do
# Then, download the project from this repository (any way works as long as you can assess it, would recommend downloading as ZIP and extracting the files)
# On Unity Hub, click on the arrow next to the "Open" button and click on "Add project on disk". From there, click on the extracted folder containing the project and click on "add project"
# The Project uses VRTK version 4 which can be found for free at https://www.vrtk.io/
# If you want to run the project on your computer, make sure you have CameraRigs.SpatialSimulator on and CameraRigs.UnityXRPluginFramework off and vice versa if you want it running on your Quest headset
# For the Quest headset, you will want to have developer mode on. Afterwards, when you try to connect the headset to your computer, make sure you allow access to data when the prompt on the headset shows up.
# On Unity, make sure you build the project on Android (Minimum API level of 6.0 works, this is set on player settings) and make sure the scenes in build is the ProjScene found in the scenes folder (this is set in Build Settings and you can add it by clicking the add open scenes button if it doesn't appear)
# While in Build Settings, also make sure the run device is set to the Oculus Quest that you connected to your computer. After this, you click build and run. This will take some time at first but is faster later on. Once it is running on your headset, you can unplug the headset from your computer and it should run without problems. 
# Now you should be able to enjoy the project to your heart's content.
